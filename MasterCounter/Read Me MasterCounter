Master Counter example for WebCatalog 2.0This WebDNA example will count hits to any page in your site that WebCatalog 2.0 serves up.  It automatically figures out the URL of the page that was hit, and the last date the page was accessed.  It was inspired by a WebDNA snippet from gary@panavise.com.This example requires WebCatalog 2.0, of course.Installation:1) Place the MasterCounter folder in your WebSTAR folder (at the root)2) Paste [include /MasterCounter/MasterCounter.inc] into any page you want to be counted.3) Link to /MasterCounter/Report.tmpl to see a reportAlternately, you can use MasterCounter2.inc to only count hits from outside your IP range.  You must modify the file by typing in the first 3 parts of your IP address, making sure you use 3 digits for each section: 127.007.029 not 127.7.29
